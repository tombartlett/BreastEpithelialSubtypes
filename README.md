<h2>Breast Epithelial Subtypes</h2>

Estimates breast tissue cell-type proportions from DNA methylation microarry data, including the breast epithelium cell-subtypes luminal progenitor, mature luminal, and basal, based on reference profiles $\mathbf{A}\in\mathbb{R}^{p\times k}$ derived from Pellicani et al (2016), defined for $p$ genes on $k$ cell-types. We model bulk-data matrix $\mathbf{X}\in\mathbb{R}^{p\times n}$ for $n$ bulk-tissue samples as:
\begin{equation*}
\mathbf{X}=\mathbf{A}\mathbf{W}+\boldsymbol{\epsilon},
\end{equation*}
estimating the matrix of cell-type proportions $\mathbf{W}\in[0,1]^{k\times n}$ via robust partial correlations (Teschendorff et al 2017), to solve
\begin{equation*}
\mathbf{W}_{:,i}=\mathbf{A}^\dagger\mathbf{X}_{:,i}
\end{equation*}
where $\dagger$ is pseudo-inverse, estimated using the rpc() function from the MASS package in R.
